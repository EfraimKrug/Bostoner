<p>If you want to donate to the web development team... (so far that is just me). You can put a sign on the page - 
"In memory of...", "In honor of...", "I feel good because...", or "Baruch HaShem... and who needs a reason for that?!?"</p>
<p>So - whatever the reason, whatever your request - just write it up in the "<i>Web Donation</i>" space above. What
ever you put there just goes to me to see... nobody else will see it until I use it or put it elsewhere - 
so just tell me what to do!!! </p>
<p>I do want to remind you - the money given via this particular button - this one below (yup - the one on this 
particular page) sends money to me (Efraim) for my web-efforts... currently I have put in time and money... and
there may be more money needed!</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>
